# Crossword Solver
This application is used to search word or list of words from the English Dictionary with matching user input search pattern.


The requirements are as follows:

    User needs to be able to input the word length, and what known letters there are. You can use any format you want for this input, but it should be understandable.
    The program should return all words in the dictionary that are the correct length and that contain those letters at those positions.
    The algorithm should be fast. How fast is fast? Well, that’s a bit subjective, but we’ve come up with some extremely fast ones.
    Startup time and memory usage are secondary concerns.
    Code should be well formatted/designed/complete.
